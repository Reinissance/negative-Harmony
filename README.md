# Negative Harmony MIDI Player
A web MIDI file player with the capability to playback in [negative harmony](https://www.opussciencecollective.com/post/the-harmonic-upside-down-negative-harmony) or backwards while providing also a score rendered by [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs/) (using a [WASM build](https://github.com/Reinissance/midi2abcWASM) of midi2abc from the [abcmidi package](https://github.com/sshlien/abcmidi)).

This tool loads and plays back MIDI files using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), alters the note pitches and renders the audio with [WebAudioFont](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont), while the user can select alternative sounds per channel or drumnote.

## Usage

### Basic

Select an example or upload a MIDI file and hit play.

### Search MIDIs from [bitmidi](https://bitmidi.com/) or manually search an external MIDI File

You can search for MIDI files from bitmidis huge database of MIDI files directly in the input field.

Alternatively load a MIDI file from an external link, provided the CORS headers of the source allow it (most files on bitmidi, [mfiles](https://www.mfiles.co.uk/midi-files.htm) or [midikaos](https://midikaos.mnstrl.org/) do) - just copy the download url of a file and paste into into the input field.

### External MIDI Devices

By default the app uses soundfonts from [WebAudioFont](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont), but if an external MIDI keyboard and/or a multitimbral sound module is connected to your device, they can be used as well.
With a midikeyboard attached you can also play in negative mode in realtime.

### Reverse

The playback can be switched to reversed, which simply results in playing backwards. Notes longer than a quarter are then started at the note's end (aka note-off time).

## Modes

- **Normal**: Simple MIDI playback.
- **Left-hand Piano**: Inverts notes around middle D (MIDI number 62), except for drum channel 10.
- **Negative Harmony**: Inverts notes around the root's thirds, except for drum channel 10. The axis lies between major and minor 3rds, so the latter becomes the former, the root becomes the 5th, and vice versa. The root of the loaded MIDI file is tried to be detected automatically, but can be changed manually.

For the last two modes pitch bend messages are turned upside down as well.

## Per Octave / per Voice

Negative harmony inverts the piece, making the bass the highest voice for example. Therefor you can invert notes per octave for left-hand and negative harmony modes, keeping everything close to its original place. This may cause melodies to switch octaves unexpectedly when in per oKtave mode, allthough the leading tones are respected by setting the root. Changing the root of the piece shifts this point in the negatively harmonized tuned voices (apart from also transposing it).
If per Voice is selected each channel is individually turned upside down around an axis lying in the middle of the voices range, respecting the selected root.

## Instrument Settings

You can adjust settings such as the global speed, or for each instrument (aka each channel individually) the volume, panning and reverb, or [change the instruments (override programChange Messages)](https://reinissance.github.io/negative-Harmony/index.html?midiFile=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmidi.com%2Fuploads%2F3654.mid&channels=%257B%25220%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_0%2522%253A%2522127%2522%257D%252C%25221%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_1%2522%253A%2522109%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_1%2522%253A%25220%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_1%2522%253A%252232%2522%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%2522123%2522%252C%2522panSlider_1%2522%253A%2522-0.42%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_1%2522%253A%25220.31%2522%257D%252C%25222%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_2%2522%253A%252299%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_2%2522%253A%2522110%2522%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%252244%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_2%2522%253A%25221%2522%252C%2522panSlider_2%2522%253A%2522-0.31%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_2%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%25223%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_3%2522%253A%252269%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_3%2522%253A%252257%2522%252C%2522panSlider_3%2522%253A%25220.14%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_3%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%25224%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_4%2522%253A%252240%2522%252C%2522panSlider_4%2522%253A%2522-0.59%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_4%2522%253A%2522122%2522%257D%252C%25225%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_5%2522%253A%252253%2522%252C%2522panSlider_5%2522%253A%25220.76%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_5%2522%253A%2522127%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_5%2522%253A%25225%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_5%2522%253A%25220.8%2522%257D%252C%25226%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_6%2522%253A%252233%2522%252C%2522panSlider_6%2522%253A%2522-0.63%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_6%2522%253A%2522107%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_6%2522%253A%25220.5%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_6%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%25227%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_7%2522%253A%252240%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_7%2522%253A%2522104%2522%252C%2522panSlider_7%2522%253A%2522-0.01%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_7%2522%253A%25221%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_7%2522%253A%25220.47%2522%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%2522120%2522%257D%252C%25228%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_8%2522%253A%2522111%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_8%2522%253A%2522115%2522%252C%2522panSlider_8%2522%253A%25220.84%2522%257D%252C%25229%2522%253A%257B%2522drumNoteSelectClosed%2520Hi-hat%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectSnare%2520Drum%25201%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectLow%2520Tom%25201%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectLow%2520Tom%25202%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectPedal%2520Hi-hat%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectBass%2520Drum%25201%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectCrash%2520Cymbal%25201%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectCrash%2520Cymbal%25202%2522%253A2%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%2522107%2522%252C%2522drumNoteSelectBass_Drum_1%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectClosed_Hi-hat%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectSnare_Drum_1%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectCrash_Cymbal_1%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectCrash_Cymbal_2%2522%253A2%252C%2522drumNoteSelectPedal_Hi-hat%2522%253A2%257D%252C%252210%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_10%2522%253A%252238%2522%252C%2522panSlider_10%2522%253A%25220.67%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_10%2522%253A%2522108%2522%252C%2522sfIndex_10%2522%253A%25221%2522%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%2522122%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_10%2522%253A%25220.82%2522%257D%252C%252215%2522%253A%257B%2522volumeSlider_15%2522%253A%2522127%2522%252C%2522volumeSlider_drum%2522%253A%2522107%2522%252C%2522panSlider_15%2522%253A%2522-0.61%2522%257D%257D&perOktave=1&mode=0&negRoot=61&reverbGain=1.5&irUrl=2), or switch to another soundfont, or even override single drumSounds to another (notes on drumchannel 10), like exchange the snare with a closed hihat for example.

## Sharing

If you pasted an url a share button will be provided: The url shared will include the linked file. Thus you can for example share links to specific files like: [Ludwig's Knocking Fate](https://reinissance.github.io/negative-Harmony/index.html?midiFile=https://bitmidi.com/uploads/34948.mid).
The url shared will also include any change you made to instruments settings (and therefor may become very long).
Settings shared this way will override any midi control message in the file. This ways you can change for example also the [intrumentation of a piece](https://reinissance.github.io/negative-Harmony/index.html?midiFile=https%3A%2F%2Fbitmidi.com%2Fuploads%2F27670.mid&channels=%257B%25220%2522%253A%257B%2522instrumentSelect_0%2522%253A%252218%2522%252C%2522panSlider_0%2522%253A%2522-0.65%2522%257D%252C%25221%2522%253A%257B%2522instrumentSelect_1%2522%253A%252218%2522%252C%2522panSlider_1%2522%253A%2522-0.56%2522%257D%252C%25222%2522%253A%257B%2522instrumentSelect_2%2522%253A%252218%2522%252C%2522panSlider_2%2522%253A%2522-0.56%2522%252C%2522reverbSlider_2%2522%253A%25220.84%2522%257D%252C%25223%2522%253A%257B%2522panSlider_3%2522%253A%25220.53%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_3%2522%253A%252232%2522%257D%252C%25224%2522%253A%257B%2522sfIndex_4%2522%253A%25221%2522%252C%2522instrumentSelect_4%2522%253A%252264%2522%257D%257D&perOktave=1&mode=2&negRoot=59&reverbGain=1.01&irUrl=2&speed=0.91). When settings for a channel differ from those of the loaded midi file, a "reset to File Settings"- button will be provided.

## Download
You can also download the current state and settings as standard MIDI-file.
